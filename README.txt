For this project, Amanda and Lexi collaborated slightly with Brad Jesteadt, Brandon Pfoff, and Luke Leonard.
We have at least 5 game pieces - Dragon, Food, Guard, Prize, Sniper, and Trap (that's 6).
Most pieces return NONE when the player isn't in the right spot. 
The Dragon, Guard, and Trap all HIT the player when in certain positions. 
The Sniper KILLs the player if he's residing at a certain unknown location.
The Food ADVANCEs the player when at the same place.
The PRIZE allows the player to GET_POINT. 
Only the Food, Prize, and Trap interact on the same place - the others do more special interactions.
The Dragon moves randomly and the Guard walks back and forth.
The Chair does not do anything, and is only Drawable (not a GamePiece)
There are two levels - the second of which is harder as it has the Dragon.
The UML diagram is attached. 
This README should help describe how the requirements are all met.
The coding style also should be met.
